            <p>Once upon a time, a university student loved cars. He was also a computer science student. So when he wanted to trade his Chevy Camaro for a cooler car, he decided to make his own website dedicated to trading vehicles. There were already other websites like Facebook Marketplace, Autotrader, and Craigslist for just selling your vehicle, but there was no good website for exchanging it for someone else's. So he made this website! We hope you enjoy it and find your dream ride here!</p>
