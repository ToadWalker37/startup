            <p>A university student loved cars. He was also a computer science student. So when he wanted to trade his Chevy Camaro for a cooler car, he made his own website dedicated to trading vehicles.</p>
            <p>This is your one-stop shop for finding cars to swap. If you want to turn your car into cash, you can do that on another website. But want to turn your car into another car? You're at the best place for that.</p>
            <p>We hope you enjoy it and find your dream ride here!</p>
