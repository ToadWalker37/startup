# C S 260 Notes

### Github
- You don't have to use SSH to clone into a repo
- Committing is not the same as pushing, since pushing brings it back to Github while committing is just saving it

### Web Servers / Domains / DNS
- Server IP address: http://35.168.155.223/
- Command to ssh into server: ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
- You have to link a domain name to an IP address so DNS can point you to the right server with the right domain name
